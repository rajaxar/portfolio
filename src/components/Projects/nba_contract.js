                    In 2020, the world was grappling with a global pandemic, and the NBA was also struggling.
                    The league somehow pulled off playoffs after a total hiatus in both games and training, leading to a spectacular Bubble Season.<br /><br />

                    Players went on the record to discuss how they felt uncertain about playing that year - Jayson Tatum famously said that free agent players were{' '}

                    So that makes sense - players are concerned about how much they can earn in the future. Let's see how this is reflected in their performance.

                    Not exactly - there has been a lot of prior research on this topic, showing different methodologies, and coming to some different conclusions.

                            (Jean, Neal, Duke University, 2010) - This paper used Points, Rebounds, Steals, Blocks, and Assists to measure player performance. They found that players performed better in their contract year, but did not find a significant difference in performance in the year after.

The other is a new one - this one shows how much a player's salary increases based on their change in performance during the contract year.

                            For Managers and Coaches, it's important to understand how players are motivated. Knowing that your rising new Center is in their contract year can be a good indicator that they might be looking to improve their game.
                        </li><br /><li>
                            For Players, we saw earlier that they felt immense pressure to perform in their contract year. It's important to understand that the pressure might not be worth it - the data shows that the change in performance doesn't always lead to an increase in salary.
                        </li><br /><li>
                            And for Fans, it's just another layer of the game to understand. It's easy to remember the players that had a breakout year in their contract year, but that's not the whole story - it's good to remember the players that didn't.
