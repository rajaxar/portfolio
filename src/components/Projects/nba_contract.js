                <p className="nba-text">

                    In 2020, the world was grappling with a global pandemic, and the NBA was also struggling.
                    The league somehow pulled off playoffs after a total hiatus in both games and training, leading to a spectacular Bubble Season.<br /><br />
                    <span className="nba-note">
                        I'm still wondering where that <span style={{ color: '#86020e', fontWeight: 500 }}>

                    Players went on the record to discuss how they felt uncertain about playing that year - Jayson Tatum famously said that free agent players were{' '}

                    {' '}by deciding they had to risk their health to secure a good contract.
                    <br /><br />
                    So that makes sense - players are concerned about how much they can earn in the future. Let's see how this is reflected in their performance.

                    Not exactly - there has been a lot of prior research on this topic, showing different methodologies, and coming to some different conclusions.

                            (Jean, Neal, Duke University, 2010) - This paper used Points, Rebounds, Steals, Blocks, and Assists to measure player performance. They found that players performed better in their contract year, but did not find a significant difference in performance in the year after.

                            (Gaffaney, Tyler, Claremont McKenna College, 2013) - This paper used percent deviation from career average, and delineated players by age, position, and skill level. They found that certain players underperformed in their contract year, while others did not.

                            (Ryan, Julian, Harvard College, 2015) - This paper used advanced metrics such as PER and WAR to measure player performance, and also delineated between different types of contract situations. They found a 3-5% increase in performance for median players in their contract year.

                            (Shields Wald, Ezekiel, UC Santa Barbara, 2016) - This paper used a different economic theory to explain the contract year phenomenon - finding evidence that players that were "overvalued" tended to be the ones that improved in their contract year.

                    </ul>
                    So what does this all mean? <br /> There are a lot of factors that go into seeing the relationship between player performance and contract year.<br /><br />What might make it easier to understand is to see the data for ourselves.

                    One of the graphs below covers what weâ€™ve already seen - the estimated percentage distributions for player performance, delineated by year related to contract. The other is a new one - this one shows how much a player's salary increases based on their change in performance during the contract year.

                        Try seeing how Young Centers do in their contract year, or how younger Point Guards tend to get rewarded versus older Point Guards.

                            For Managers and Coaches, it's important to understand how players are motivated. Knowing that your rising new Center is in their contract year can be a good indicator that they might be looking to improve their game.
                        </li><br /><li>
                            For Players, we saw earlier that they felt immense pressure to perform in their contract year. It's important to understand that the pressure might not be worth it - the data shows that the change in performance doesn't always lead to an increase in salary.
                        </li><br /><li>
                            And for Fans, it's just another layer of the game to understand. It's easy to remember the players that had a breakout year in their contract year, but that's not the whole story - it's good to remember the players that didn't.
